# headless-shopify-test01
A demo site for how to build a headless shopify site on nuxt, also using tailwind css, imgix, and Vercel to host.

Wrote an article on [dev.to](https://dev.to/daletom/headless-shopify-with-nuxt-tailwind-imgix-vercel-1ldg) if you would like to see a tutorial. There is also a [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI_JpzCTUX8&t=2s) as well.
